# Overview Of Election_Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to sort the election results by candidate and County to determine the winner of the Election 

# Election Audit Results
  For this project, I were given a scenario where a Colorado Board of Elections employee requested my help in completing an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The following tasks were performd by me to be included in the completed election audit:

Calculate the total number of votes cast
Calculate the list of candidates who received votes
Calculate the list of counties were votes were cast
Calculate the total number and percentage of votes each candidate received
Calculate the total number and percentage of votes that were cast in each county
Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
Determine the county that received the highest number of votes
Present our outcome printed to the terminal and a separate output text file.
In order to execute this anlaysis, we obtained a .CSV file of the election results. We imported the data into python, ran the code we created and extracted the results into an output .txt file.

The breakdown of the Election audit analysis is as follows ;-

# Election Audit Summary
We created an effective and dynamic tool for election auditing. The software created provides accurate results swiftly that can be broken down into categories for future election planning and for real time election Tracking. By converting spreadsheet data into dictionaries and databases we can highlight and cross reference information to enable precise reporting through the general structure of the code. It should be applicaple to any type of general election by county without changing the code. The only thing you would have to change is which csv file was being looked at.
